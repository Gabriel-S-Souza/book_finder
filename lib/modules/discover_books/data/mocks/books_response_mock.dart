            "Saiba o que o Flutter tem para oferecer, de onde ele veio e para onde vai. O desenvolvimento de aplicativos móveis está progredindo rapidamente, e com o Flutter – um SDK open source de desenvolvimento de aplicações móveis criado pelo Google – você pode desenvolver aplicações para Android e iOS, assim como para o Google Fuchsia. Você aprenderá a criar três aplicativos (um gerenciador de informações pessoais, um sistema de chat e um projeto de game) que poderá instalar em seus dispositivos móveis e de fato usar. Começará ganhando uma base sólida sobre o Flutter e a usará imediatamente para construir dois aplicativos de produtividade mais tradicionais. Também aprenderá a criar um game, o que lhe permitirá ter uma perspectiva totalmente diferente do que o Flutter pode fazer. Além de construir esses aplicativos, você se beneficiará da verificação de problemas do mundo real com os quais pode deparar, e de maneiras de lidar com eles com dicas e truques, tudo isso pensado para tornar sua experiência com o Flutter muito mais produtiva e, na verdade, divertida! Flutter na Prática lhe dará uma base sólida de como construir aplicativos com o Flutter, e será um trampolim para a criação de aplicativos mais avançados por sua própria conta. Após a leitura deste material, uma jornada maior começará à medida que você entrar, mais bem preparado, no imenso universo do desenvolvimento com o Flutter, abordando com firmeza qualquer projeto com o qual deparar. Flutter na Prática é uma aventura de aprendizado que não deve ser perdida.",

            "Create iOS and Android apps with Flutter using just one codebase. App development on multiple platforms has historically been difficult and complex. This book breaks down complex concepts and tasks into easily digestible segments with examples, pictures, and hands-on labs with starters and solutions. In doing so, you'll develop a basic understanding of the Dart programming language; the entire Flutter development toolchain; the differences between stateful and stateless widgets; and a working knowledge of the architecture of apps. All the most important parts of app development with Flutter are covered in this book. Work with themes and styles. Develop custom widgets. Teach your app to respond to gestures like taps, swipes, and pinches. Design, create and control the layout of your app. Create tools to handle form data entry from users. And ultimately create killer multiscreen apps with navigation, menus, and tabs. Flutter is Google's new framework for creating mobile apps that run on iOS and Android phones both.You had to be a super-developer to write apps for iOS or Android alone. But writing for both? Forget about it! You had to be familiar with Swift, Java/Kotlin, Xcode, Eclipse, and a bunch of other technologies simultaneously. Beginning App Development with Flutter simplifies the entire process. What You'll Learn Get the most out of great Flutter widgets Create custom widgets, both stateless and statefulExercise expert control over your Flutter layoutsMake your app respond to gestures like swiping, pinching and tappingInitiate async Ajax calls to RESTful APIs — including Google Firebase! Who This Book Is ForDevelopers who have coded in Java, C#, C++, or any similar language. It brings app development within the reach of younger developers, so STEM groups are likely to pick up the technology. Managers, product owners, and business analysts need to understand Flutter's capabilities.",

            "Summary In 2017, consumers downloaded 178 billion apps, and analysts predict growth to 258 billion by 2022. Mobile customers are demanding more—and better—apps, and it’s up to developers like you to write them! Flutter, a revolutionary new cross-platform software development kit created by Google, makes it easier than ever to write secure, high-performance native apps for iOS and Android. Flutter apps are blazingly fast because this open source solution compiles your Dart code to platform-specific programs with no JavaScript bridge! Flutter also supports hot reloading to update changes instantly. And thanks to its built-in widgets and rich motion APIs, Flutter’s apps are not just highly responsive, they’re stunning! Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the technology With Flutter, you can build mobile applications using a single, feature-rich SDK that includes everything from a rendering engine to a testing environment. Flutter compiles programs written in Google’s intuitive Dart language to platform-specific code so your iOS and Android games, utilities, and shopping platforms all run like native Java or Swift apps. About the book Flutter in Action teaches you to build professional-quality mobile applications using the Flutter SDK and the Dart programming language. You’ll begin with a quick tour of Dart essentials and then dive into engaging, well-described techniques for building beautiful user interfaces using Flutter’s huge collection of built-in widgets.

Along with an introduction to the basic concepts of Flutter development, the recipes in this book cover all important aspects of this emerging technology, including development, testing, debugging, performance tuning, app publishing, and continuous integration. Although Flutter presents a rich, cross-platform mobile development framework, helpful documentation is not easily found. Here you’ll review solutions to various scenarios and use creative, tested ways to accomplish everything from simple to complex development tasks. Flutter is developed using Dart and contains a unique technology stack that sets it apart from its competitors. This book takes the mystery out of working with the Dart language and integrating Flutter into your already existing workflows and development projects. With Flutter Recipes, you’ll learn how to build and deploy apps freshly started in Flutter, as well as apps already in progress, while side-stepping any potential roadblocks you may face along the way. What You'll Learn Debug with Dart Observatory Program accessibility and localization features Build and release apps for iOS and Android Incorporate reactive programming Who This Book Is For Mobile developers with some experience in other frameworks who would like to work with the growing and popular Flutter.",
